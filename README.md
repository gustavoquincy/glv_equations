# use Thrust/CUDA to solve one kind of Lotka-Volterra equation 

The [docs](./html/) folder contains the documentation of [glv_equation.cu](./glv_equation.cu) generated by Doxygen. 

To run the code, first compile the code with `nvcc -std=c++11`. Currently, cuda 10.1 would compile with `nvcc -std=c++11 glv_equation.cu -o glv_equation`. Upload the executable to the computing clusters, and make sure the driver version of GPU matches the CUDA toolkit version, e.g. 11.4. Then the program is good to generate data with specified GPU configurations in the scheduling script.

The code is created for demonstrative purposes only.
