In C++, we have hpp and cpp files separately, and thus put declarations and definitions in separate files. Compilers, e.g. gcc+, compiles the hpp file and produces an executable, for instance, the `a.out` file here, and then the program can run. `.h` file and `.hpp` file can be used interchangeably. The [Thrust toolkit](https://thrust.github.io/) gives examples on how to parallelize C++ programs in clusters.
