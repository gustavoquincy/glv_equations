# Some helpful information

In C++, we have hpp and cpp files separately, and thus put declarations and definitions in separate files. Compilers, e.g. gcc+, compiles the hpp file and produces an executable, for instance, the `a.out` file here, and then the program can run. `.h` file and `.hpp` file can be used interchangeably. The [Thrust toolkit](https://thrust.github.io/) gives examples on how to parallelize C++ programs in clusters. [lorenz_parameters.cu](./lorenz_parameters.cu) is a related  exmaple on how to vary parameters in ODE systems in CUDA. 

The [html](./html/) folder contains the documentation of [glv_equation.cu](./glv_equation.cu) generated by Doxygen.
